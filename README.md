A Chrome Extension that displays the Likes to Views ratio on YouTube videos.

This may be helpful in some cases, since the dislike count has been removed.

"May be" because a good video is not necessary the one that causes a strong-enough emotion, so that people will click the like button. But many people will watch it → low likes/views ratio. Or in the case of music videos, a person will listen to one multiple times.

And at least in the beginning, people won't have a benchmark for what is good (3.4%, 1.2%,... what does that mean?). Compared to the earlier version of YouTube, just look at the likes/dislikes bar and if 20% are dislikes, then the video is bad.
