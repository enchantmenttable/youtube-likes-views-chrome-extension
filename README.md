# youtube-likes-views-chrome-extension
A Chrome Extension that displays the Likes to Views ratio on YouTube videos.

This may be helpful in some cases, since the dislike count has been removed.

"May be" because a good video is not necessary the one that causes a strong-enough emotion, so that people will click the like button. But many people will watch it → low likes/views ratio. Or in the case of music videos, a person will listen to one song multiple times.

And at least in the beginning, people won't have a benchmark for what is good (3.4%, 1.2%,... what does that mean?). Compared to the earlier version of YouTube, just look at the likes/dislikes bar and if 20% are dislikes, then the video is bad.

A great extension that reveals the dislike count is: https://www.returnyoutubedislike.com/

[The maker of the extension said](https://github.com/Anarios/return-youtube-dislike#:~:text=With%20the%20removal%20of%20dislike%20stats%20from%20the%20YouTube%20API%2C%20our%20backend%20will%20switch%20to%20using%20a%20combination%20of%20scraped%20dislike%20stats%2C%20estimates%20extrapolated%20from%20extension%20user%20data%20and%20estimates%20based%20on%20view%5Clike%20ratios.) YouTube will remove the dislike stats from YouTube API. So I make this in case that extension stops working properly.
